## 4. Typography

### Primary Brand Font: **Antapani**

The Antapani typeface has been selected for its modern geometry, high legibility, and technical feel, making it ideal for a biotech brand.

### Font Usage Guidance

*   **Corporate Communication:** Use for headings, titles, and official statements to convey authority.
*   **Scientific Documents:** ensuring readability in dense technical reports and data tables.
*   **Digital Interfaces:** Optimized for screen legibility in apps, dashboards, and websites.

### Consistency Rules
*   **Do not** substitute Antapani with generic fonts like Arial or Times New Roman unless technically unavoidable (e.g., plain text emails).
*   **Hierarchy:** Use bold weights for headings and regular or light weights for body text to maintain a clear information hierarchy.
*   **Alignment:** Left-align text for standard documentation to improve readability.

---

## 5. Color Palette – Antapani Brand Colors

The approved color palette is restricted to these core values to maintain a specialized and professional look.

### Primary Dark Color
**Hex:** `#3D3C3C`  
**Usage:** Main text, dark backgrounds, neutral scientific layouts.  
**Role:** Provides a softer, more sophisticated alternative to pure black, reducing eye strain in data-heavy environments.

### Primary Accent Color
**Hex:** `#E9393B`  
**Usage:** Key highlights, emphasis, call-to-action buttons, brand accents.  
**Role:** injects energy and attention where needed, without overwhelming the scientific content.

### Guidelines
*   **Do not** introduce non-approved colors (e.g., standard blue or green).
*   **Contrast:** Ensure high contrast between text and background to meet accessibility standards and ensure legibility.
*   **Reproduction:** When printing, ensure color matching is as close as possible to these Hex values (convert to CMYK if necessary based on vendor specs).

## 6. Approved Logo Assets

The following files located in the `Final Logo` handover folder are the **ONLY** approved versions for use.

### Light Mode Logo
**Files:** `Final-logo.png`, `Final-logo.jpg`, `Final-logo.svg`  
**Usage:** For white or light-colored backgrounds.  
**Appearance:** Dark text/icon elements on a transparent or white background.

### Dark Mode Logo
**Files:** `Final-logo-dark.png`, `Final-logo-dark.jpg`, `Final-logo-dark.svg`  
**Usage:** For dark or colored backgrounds (e.g., dark mode UI, dark presentation slides).  
**Appearance:** White or light text/icon elements on a transparent background.

### File Format Rules
*   **SVG (Vector):** Best for web, large format print, and scalable layouts. *Always use SVG when possible.*
*   **PNG (Raster):** Use for digital assets requiring transparency (e.g., PowerPoint overlays, web headers).
*   **JPG (Raster):** Use for general-purpose documents or opaque backgrounds where transparency is not supported.

**IMPORTANT:** Do not alter, recolor, or recreate the logo. Always use the provided files.

## 7. Logo Usage on Backgrounds

### Correct Usage
*   **Light Backgrounds:** Use the **Light Mode Logo**. Ensure the background is light enough (e.g., white, light gray) to provide clear contrast with the `#3D3C3C` elements.
*   **Dark Backgrounds:** Use the **Dark Mode Logo**. The background should be dark enough (e.g., `#3D3C3C` or black) to let the white elements stand out.
*   **Scientific Context:** In technical diagrams or posters, place the logo in a dedicated white space or quiet area to avoid clashing with data visuals.

### Avoid
*   **Busy Backgrounds:** Do not place the logo over complex photos or patterns that obscure its details.
*   **Low Contrast:** Do not place the Light Mode logo on a dark gray background or the Dark Mode logo on a light beige background.

---

## 8. Clear Space & Minimum Size

### Clear Space
To preserve the integrity and impact of the logo, always maintain a minimum clear space around it. No other elements (text, graphics, page edges) should encroach on this zone.
*   **Rule:** The clear space should be equal to at least half the height of the logo icon on all sides.

### Minimum Size
*   **Digital / Web:** Minimum height of **32px**. Ensure text remains readable on mobile screens.
*   **Print:** Minimum width of **25mm (1 inch)**.
*   **Legibility:** If the logo must be smaller than these sizes, consult the brand team; often, just the brand mark (icon) should be used instead of the full logomark.

---

## 9. Incorrect Logo Usage (Do’s & Don’ts)

Strict adherence to these rules is mandatory.

*   **DON'T** Stretch or distort the logo aspect ratio. Always resize proportionally.
*   **DON'T** Change the colors of the logo parts (e.g., making the text blue).
*   **DON'T** Add drop shadows, gradients, strokes, or other effects.
*   **DON'T** Rotate or skew the logo.
*   **DON'T** Place the logo on a background that renders it illegible.
*   **DON'T** Use outdated or draft versions of the logo.
*   **DON'T** Re-type the text using a different font; use the image file.

## 10. File Format Usage Guide

### SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
*   **Best For:** Websites, mobile apps, professional printing (brochures, banners).
*   **Why:** Infinite scalability without quality loss. Small file size.

### PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
*   **Best For:** Digital presentations (PowerPoint/Keynote), social media, website images.
*   **Why:** Supports transparency (no white box around the logo).

### JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
*   **Best For:** Word documents, email bodies, internal non-design usage.
*   **Why:** Widely compatible, small file size, but does not support transparency.

*Note: These files are final. Editing the vector paths or rasterizing them at low quality is strictly prohibited.*

## 11. Biotech-Specific Applications

### Corporate Website
Use the SVG logo in the header. Ensure it links back to the homepage. Use the `#3D3C3C` color for main text to reduce eye strain for readers digesting long scientific content.

### Scientific Presentations & Reports
Use the PNG logo with transparency on title slides. In headers/footers of reports, ensure the logo is small but legible, adhering to clear space rules.

### Research Documentation
Maintain a formal tone. The logo should act as a seal of quality. Do not crowd the logo with co-branding unless a specific partnership guidelines document exists.

### Conference & Event Materials
Use high-resolution SVG or PDF versions of the logo for large banners and booth backdrops to prevent pixelation.

### Email Signatures
Use a small, fixed-width PNG logo (e.g., 150px wide) at the bottom of the signature block.

### Social Media
Use the logo (or brand mark) centered in the profile picture area. Ensure no text is cut off by circular cropping.
